APP:

a perfect little granular abstraction - keep basic - flow

> user clicks Rust binary executable
> opens default browser with hardcoded-default
> user clicks splash page user agreement to create, save, and run a local HTML/CSS/JS folder
> 

FRONTEND:

rust API for interacting with default browser: https://docs.rs/webbrowser/latest/webbrowser/
- will need classic HTML/CSS/JS
rust API for requested HTML pages

BACKEND:

-hardcoded curl command
-binary Rust

functions that run network calls on the terminal

- hardcoded in the terminal
- hardcoded in an executed Rust binary
- terminal UI parameter entry



compile and run on windows or linux
